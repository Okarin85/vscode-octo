<h1 id="octo-extensions">Octo Extensions</h1>
<p>In the process of developing Octo, I have written and studied many Chip8 and SuperChip8 programs. I have also researched historical attempts to extend Chip8 such as <a href="http://mattmik.com/downloads/viper/Volume2Issue08_09.pdf">CHIP-8E</a> as well as more modern and less conservative approaches like <a href="https://github.com/chip16/chip16">Chip16</a>. Chip8 has a simple, elegant instruction set which is easy to learn, but using it extensively reveals some shortcomings which limit the kinds of programs which can be written (to say nothing of convenience). In this document I will describe a series of extended instructions Octo provides called “XO-Chip” which, like SuperChip8, retain backwards compatibility with the original Chip8 instructions. The additions are sparing and try to retain some degree of historical plausibility and the flavor of Chip8’s creative limitations. Authors of future Chip8 interpreters are encouraged to provide support for these instructions.</p>

<p>The XO-Chip instructions are summarized as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">save vx - vy</code> (<code class="highlighter-rouge">0x5XY2</code>) save an inclusive range of registers to memory starting at <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">load vx - vy</code> (<code class="highlighter-rouge">0x5XY3</code>) load an inclusive range of registers from memory starting at <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">i := long NNNN</code> (<code class="highlighter-rouge">0xF000, 0xNNNN</code>) load <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> with a 16-bit address.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">plane n</code> (<code class="highlighter-rouge">0xFN01</code>) select zero or more drawing planes by bitmask (0 &lt;= n &lt;= 3).</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">audio</code> (<code class="highlighter-rouge">0xF002</code>) store 16 bytes starting at <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> in the audio pattern buffer.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">scroll-up n</code> (<code class="highlighter-rouge">0x00DN</code>) scroll the contents of the display up by 0-15 pixels.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="memory-access">Memory Access</h2>
<p>Chip8 memory operations can prove clumsy. <code class="highlighter-rouge">load</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">save</code> place low registers at a premium and lead to difficulty in allocating registers. Code which attempts to load and work with two structs from memory must perform a number of copies:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>i := buffer1
load v3
v4 := v0
v5 := v1
v6 := v2
v7 := v3
i := buffer2
load v3
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Chip8E proposes a pair of instructions which load and save register ranges, specifying both a minimum and maximum (inclusive) register. XO-Chip adopts these as described using the CHIP-8E instruction encoding. Using these instructions, the above code could instead be written as:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>i := buffer1
load v4 v7
i := buffer2
load v0 v3
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Reads or writes proceed in the order the register arguments are provided. Thus, it is possible to use these instructions to do convenient in-place byte reversals:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>i := buffer1
load v0 v3   # load 4 bytes sequentially
save v3 v0   # write them back in reversed order
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>These instructions also provide another useful function. Unlike normal <code class="highlighter-rouge">load</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">store</code>, they do not postincrement <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code>. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> postincrement is useful in some situations but inconvenient in others. When a postincrement is desired the standard <code class="highlighter-rouge">load</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">store</code> instructions may be used, and when it is not desired a programmer may substitute the ranged version specifying <code class="highlighter-rouge">v0</code> as the minimum range.</p>

<h2 id="extended-memory">Extended Memory</h2>
<p>The design of Chip8 instructions with immediate addresses such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">jump</code> limit Chip8 to a 4k address space, of which the low 512b is reserved for historical reasons. It would be difficult to expand this range, and 3.5kb of code space does seem to be sufficient for many applications. However, level-based games or anything graphically intensive (including games with color graphics as described below) would benefit tremendously from expanded space for data. The COSMAC-VIP had a 16-bit address space of which <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> can only conventionally access 12 bits. We propose an addition which allows the programmer to load a 16-bit immediate value into <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> via a double-width instruction. The sequence:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>i := long 0xNNNN
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Compiles into a header instruction <code class="highlighter-rouge">0xF000</code> followed by a pair of bytes <code class="highlighter-rouge">0xNNNN</code> which specify the value to store in <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code>. The semantics of <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> remain identical to their normal behavior.</p>

<h2 id="bitplanes">Bitplanes</h2>
<p>Chip8 has a unique XOR-drawing approach to graphics which provides interesting challenges and solutions. However, with only 2 colors available there are many interesting kinds of games which cannot feasibly be rendered- for example, puzzle games where color matching is a key mechanic such as <em>Puyo-Puyo</em> or <em>Dr. Mario</em>. It would be nice to augment Chip8 with the ability to draw a few additional colors without losing the unique flavor of its graphics drawing mode.</p>

<p>XO-Chip expands the display with a second drawing bitplane. The first bitplane functions exactly as normal in Chip8 or SuperChip8 mode. The second bitplane is superimposed on the first and draws in a different color. Where set pixels on both bitplanes overlap they are drawn using another color. This approach is thus capable of drawing images containing up to 4 colors- The background color, the first drawing plane’s color, the second drawing plane’s color and the color used when both planes overlap. Which colors appear on the display are left up to the implementation and may be grayscale, a preset palette or user-configurable.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">plane</code> instruction takes a 2-bit bitmask which selects one, both or neither of the drawing planes, with the least significant bit being the first drawing plane. Thus, <code class="highlighter-rouge">plane 1</code> selects only the first drawing plane, <code class="highlighter-rouge">plane 2</code> selects only the second and <code class="highlighter-rouge">plane 3</code> selects both. By default, only the first drawing plane is selected for compatibility with normal Chip8 operation. <code class="highlighter-rouge">clear</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">sprite</code> and the various <code class="highlighter-rouge">scroll-</code> instructions apply only to the selected drawing plane(s). It is thus possible to scroll one plane as a “background” while a “foreground” remains fixed.</p>

<p>When a <code class="highlighter-rouge">sprite</code> is drawn with both planes selected the operation will consume twice as many bytes of graphics data as it normally would, first drawing the specified sprite height to the first plane and then drawing the same number of bytes to the second plane. If the sprite was 4 pixels high, the first plane would be drawn to using bytes at the addresses <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code>+3 and the second plane would be drawn using bytes at the addresses <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code>+4 to <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code>+7. This means that drawing sprites with both planes selected will naturally and conveniently draw or erase 4-color sprites. With both planes selected the <code class="highlighter-rouge">vf</code> collision flag will be set after a sprite drawing operation if pixels from <em>either</em> plane are toggled from on to off.</p>

<p>Encoding is chosen such that it would be possible to provide 4 bitplanes (and thus 16 colors!) in the future should it prove necessary. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">plane</code> instruction is placed in unpopulated space in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">0xF</code>-prefix instructions.</p>

<h2 id="audio">Audio</h2>
<p>Chip8 has the ability to make a single sound using a “buzzer”. Implementations are free to make any sound when the buzzer timer is nonzero. It would be nice to provide Chip8 programs with a simple but flexible means of making a range of different sounds. The approach chosen must make it possible to store and play back sounds without using excessive amounts of ram or CPU cycles.</p>

<p>XO-Chip provides Chip8 with a 16-byte “pattern buffer” which, when the buzzer is played, is treated as a series of 1-bit samples at 4000 samples per second which control noise made by the buzzer. By loading different patterns into the this buffer it is possible to create various square wave tones with different duty cycles as well as percussive noise. Rapidly replacing the contents of the pattern buffer should even permit crude sampled audio playback or music. The 16-byte pattern buffer can fit entirely within <code class="highlighter-rouge">v</code> registers for purposes of this kind of realtime waveform generation.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>: click
	0x02 0xCD 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
	0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00

...

i := click
audio
v0 := 2 # play for 2/60ths of a second, as expected
buzzer := v0
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Note that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">audio</code> instruction makes a copy of the values in Chip8 memory- altering memory will not change the contents of the audio buffer unless a subsequent <code class="highlighter-rouge">audio</code> instruction is fired. The initial contents of the pattern buffer is implementation-defined, so programmers wishing to use sound effects should always initialize the pattern buffer explicitly. Octo will initialize the pattern buffer to zeroes, so without initialization no sound will occur when the buzzer goes off.</p>

<p>The overloading of <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> as a means of specifying the address of the new pattern buffer is a bit inconvenient, but existing instruction encodings don’t permit any other way to specify a 12-bit immediate value. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">audio</code> instruction is placed in unpopulated space in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">0xF</code>-prefix instructions.</p>

<h2 id="scrolling">Scrolling</h2>
<p>SuperChip8 provided a set of screen scrolling instructions. These are very handy for some kinds of games, but having scrolling in only 3 directions seriously limits their utility. XO-Chip provides a <code class="highlighter-rouge">scroll-up</code> which is a functional complement to SuperChip8 <code class="highlighter-rouge">scroll-down</code>, capable of scrolling 0 to 15 pixels at a time. The encoding of <code class="highlighter-rouge">scroll-up</code> is chosen to fit the existing pattern of <code class="highlighter-rouge">scroll-down</code>.</p>
